# Complete Machine Learning

This repository is a structured learning reference for machine learning,
organized by learning paradigm and concept progression.

It reflects the order in which core machine learning topics are learned,
from foundational concepts to more advanced methods, with an emphasis on
understanding, intuition, and clear implementations.

## Repository Structure
